# Shortest-Path-In-a-Simple-Polygon
Here lies the Shortest Path in a Simple Polygon Project

In order to be able to simulate this project you have to:

Download SFML library for C++ and add configure to your path.

The path to the end result is as follows:

Giving the python program "cg_edges.py" the triangle adjacency list and the coordinates of triangle vertices (which is already inside it) to be able to compute the edge weights for each graph.

Results are stored in the file "triangle_edge_weights.json" .

The result of this graph can be visualised by the python program "edge_test.py" which is just for visualisation and has no place in the project.

The remaining(Triangulation,Shortest Path Calculation, Shortest Path Visualisation etc.) is being done by the .cpp file given.
